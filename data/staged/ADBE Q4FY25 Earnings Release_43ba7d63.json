Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its \nongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors \nshould, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with \nGAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to \nevaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency \nwith respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the \nanalyst community and others to better understand and evaluate Adobe’s operating results and future prospects in the same manner as \nmanagement.\nAdobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP \nmeasures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, investment gains \nand losses, income tax adjustments and other items that are not considered part of Adobe’s ongoing operations, and the income tax effect of \nthe non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the \nperformance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, \nAdobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are \nencouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly \ncomparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.\n9\n",
